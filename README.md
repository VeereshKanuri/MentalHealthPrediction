## Introduction

Mental health is a crucial aspect of employee well-being, and predicting treatment-seeking behavior can help companies offer better support. This project utilizes machine learning to build models that predict whether an employee is likely to seek mental health treatment based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [provide_dataset_link_here]. It contains information related to employee demographics, work-related factors, and mental health treatment history.

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop machine learning models that accurately predict whether an employee is likely to seek mental health treatment. The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, with an emphasis on F1-score due to the relevance of both false positives and false negatives.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for the project.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and utility functions.
- `README.md`: Project overview, instructions, and documentation.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features. Imputations are performed based on logical considerations and trends observed during exploratory data analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Key findings include the relationship between work interference and treatment, supporting logical imputations made during data preprocessing.

## Model Building

Several classification algorithms are employed, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest, and Boosting Algorithms. Models are trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics.

## Evaluation

Model evaluation is performed using metrics such as F1-score, considering the significance of false positives and false negatives in the context of mental health prediction.

## Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

Promising models are shortlisted, and hyperparameter tuning is applied using techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

## Conclusion

The project concludes with a summary of results, implications for real-world applications, and potential areas for improvement.
